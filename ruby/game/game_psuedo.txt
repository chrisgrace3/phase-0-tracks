One user can enter a word, and another user attempts to guess the word.

Guesses are limited, and the number of guesses available is related to the length of the word.

Repeated guesses do not count against the user.

The guessing player receives continual feedback on the current state of the word.
So if the secret word is "unicorn", the user will start out seeing something like
"_ _ _ _ _ _ _", which would become "_ _ _ c _ _ _" after the user enters a guess of "c".

The user should get a congratulatory message if they win, and a taunting message if they lose.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A word is input upon initialization

  - variable that indicates whether the game is over or not (is over: true or false)
  - counter that starts at zero and adds 1 for every unique guess.
  - if counter == length of word, game over. continue as long as counter is less
  than link of word

  if user enters a letter, and letter is in the word, return word with guessed letters
  filled in and non-guessed letters as underscores
