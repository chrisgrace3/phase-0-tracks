One user can enter a word, and another user attempts to guess the word.

Guesses are limited, and the number of guesses available is related to the length of the word.

Repeated guesses do not count against the user.

The guessing player receives continual feedback on the current state of the word.
So if the secret word is "unicorn", the user will start out seeing something like
"_ _ _ _ _ _ _", which would become "_ _ _ c _ _ _" after the user enters a guess of "c".

The user should get a congratulatory message if they win, and a taunting message if they lose.

step 1
input: word (string)
steps:
  1. split up the word by letter and put into a hash with "_" for each value
  2. return values upon each guess
output: string as underscores and message asking for word to be guessed

step 2
input: letter or word (string)
steps:
  1. check hash keys for letter, if present, change value to letter
  2. if user guesses a letter and the letter is not present, up the counter by
  one and output warning message
  3. if user guesses a word and it does not match the original word, up the counter by
  one and output warning message
  4. if user guesses the word and it is the original, output congratulatory message
  5. if user guesses exceed the length of the word, output game loss message
output:
  1. congratulations if word is correct,
  2. phrase with letter if letter is correct,
  3. please try again with number of guesses left
  4. failure message if guesses are more than length of word
