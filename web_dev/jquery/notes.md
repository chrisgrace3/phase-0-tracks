Hopefully I will find a pretty decent tutorial online somewhere. Those have been pretty helpful for me so far. I will look for at least three different tutorials to cross-reference as I study between them. I'll also look for a cheatsheet to see if there are any items that come to mind that I'm wondering are possible and are not being covered by the resources I use.

Once I have somewhat of a grasp, I will immediately begin exploring it myself, and playing with the tools.
