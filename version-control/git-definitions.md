# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?  
Version control is a **category of software tools** that allows you to track the entire
history of revisions for one or more files. It can be very useful for a software
team to manage changes to source code over time.  

* What is a branch and why would you use one?  
A branch serves as a "copy" of the master project in the same repository. The branch
can be used as an independent line of development to work on specific lines of code or
features without having any effect on the the main line.  

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?  
A commit is Git's version of a "save" command for s specific branch. Commits also allow
you to browse a history of a particular branch. A good commit message is one that
is as specific as possible, and informs anyone who is browsing a commit history
the reasons a commit was made.  

* What is a merge conflict?  
A merge conflict can occur when changes have been made on the same file in two different
areas (commonly by two different people) and Git does not know how to resolve the conflict.
