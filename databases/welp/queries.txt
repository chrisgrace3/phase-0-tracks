    You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

sqlite> SELECT * FROM businesses, users, reviews WHERE reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id;
4|Lotus Yoga|2|Mandy|Kaling|1|5|yoga was great I feel real stretchy now|4|2
6|Sushi World|7|Denzel|George|2|2|the sushi tasted weird|6|7
3|The Beagle Nightclub|5|Holly|Berry|3|4|Music was great!|3|5



    There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields.
    Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating,
    and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment  FROM businesses, users, reviews WHERE reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id;
Mandy|Kaling|Lotus Yoga|5|yoga was great I feel real stretchy now
Denzel|George|Sushi World|2|the sushi tasted weird
Holly|Berry|The Beagle Nightclub|4|Music was great!


      How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

sqlite> SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment  FROM businesses, users, reviews WHERE reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id AND businesses.id=4;
Mandy|Kaling|Lotus Yoga|5|yoga was great I feel real stretchy now
